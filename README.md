# DockerMonitoring
A centralised resource monitoring system for analysing the performance of docker containers is going to developed.Here solution would include CPU Usage, memory utilisation, number of request encountered, number of http errors. Also trying to develop some alert rules if the resource of a particular docker container is being overused. And solution is not limited to monitoring of local machines but also to many different machines hosted on different clusters.It is done by using Docker Swarm APIs which is the official API support provided for inter docker communication.
